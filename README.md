# MasterProjectIS
This repository contains all the scripts related to various processes performed on Reddit datasets, including data collection, keyword extraction, Frequent itemset mining called Apriori, classification, and other tasks such as creating distribution plots of the collected data and graph representations of the machine learning and data mining models used. It is also important to mention what some scripts might take a considerable amount of time to run and produce the desired outputs.
In order to replicate the scripts correctly, move the MasterThesis_IS_PythonNotbooks folder in the python environment such as JupyterLab and the MasterThesis_IS_R_Notebooks folder in the R Environment such as RStudio.
