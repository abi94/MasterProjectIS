 Secondly, yes, Greenwald was the hero in this situation, as was the Guardian, for returning all of the data that had nothing to do with the wiretapping program. Snowden released all sorts of stuff, and those guys saved it from getting public.
 
 Thirdly, it makes plenty of sense, as in, he didn't even know it was in his data dump. He grabbed as much as he could, and then he released it and fled. Once he was made aware that it contained the wiretapping information, he began to act like that was his purpose.

 But especially for things like retail, there has never (that I know of) really been a union for that in the US, so they are starting from a much smaller place. Just as insurance gets easier and cheaper to figure out the bigger you get, a small union doesn't necessarily have the clout to cover joint needs between places.

 > **In keeping with Google’s reporting guidelines, Glasson filed a complaint with human resources alleging pregnancy discrimination against her colleague. Shortly after, she says, the director began to retaliate against her over the report, interviewing other people to replace Glasson in her role. Glasson said HR acknowledged the retaliation but refused to stop it. She asked at the company how to face her boss when the ongoing investigation was making their relationship tense and was told multiple times to find a therapist.**
 
 Tldr: She later became pregnant herself, moved teams because she feared the same persecution, the new manager met her with even more hostility and denied her the promotion she had moved for.

 2. ⁠Facebook's own research showed that a test account with moderate conservative leanings took only 1 day to start getting QAnon content. They nicknamed the test ""Carol's Journey to QAnon"", and despite this, allowed QAnon to remain on the platform for 13 more months. More than a year after the FBI designated them as a domestic terrorist threat: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581
 3. ⁠Their own research showed that suggesting posts to users that their friends have shared radicalized people by giving pschological permission to have extreme views. Basically ""your uncle shared this racist post!"" gives people the greenlight to also share the racist post. Despite this, Zuckerberg himself refused to allow it to be fixed, saying that it would negatively impact growth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak#Promoting_anger-provoking_posts
 4. ⁠Their VP of Global Policy Joel Kaplan is a former Bush advisor and conservative lobbiest. This is important to know for a few of the next points: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kaplan
 5. ⁠Breitbart has repeatedly had enough ""strikes"" to be removed from FB's News tab, but had them waved away personally by Joel Kaplan. The News tab's policies were put into effect to address the concerns around misinformation, saying that FB would remove anyone from the tab that misinformed. Breitbart is still on there today. Facebook endorses the accuracy of Breitbart's reporting by excusing their strikes. https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-files-breitbart-news-tab-employee-objections-2021-10
 6. ⁠When FB employees noticed that the Groups feature was creating new extremist and Neo Nazi groups, they made fixes to tamp down on the hate. Joel Kaplan personally ensured that the fixes were reversed, and again said that doing this would disproportionately affect conservatives: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/28/facebook-zuckerberg-trump-hate/
 7. ⁠Joel Kaplan prevented Facebook from disclosing the effect that Russian disinformation agents had on the platform, again saying this would disproportionately affect conservatives: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-joel-kaplan-facebook-alex-jones
 8. ⁠Research has been published showing that 13% of suicidal teen girls in the UK trace their first suicidal thought to Instagram. Since learning this, Meta has chosen to make Instagram Kids, an Instagram for children: https://gizmodo.com/lawmakers-ask-zuckerberg-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-aft-1847683217
 9. ⁠In order to discredit the Whistleblower, Frances Haugen, Facebook intentionally deepened political divides as a strategy. They went to the GOP and warned them that she was a leftist political activist trying to take away conservative voices; and then went to Dem lawmakers and claimed she is a GOP political operative trying to punish Facebook for banning Trump. FB cynically tried to deepen the cracks in our damaged system just to stick it to the whistlerblower: https://nypost.com/2021/12/29/facebook-tried-to-divide-dems-gop-over-whistleblower-report/
 10. ⁠Facebook sat back and watched as its platform was used to organize a genocide. All they had to do was put the brakes on FB in one small East-Asian country, which wouldn't have even affected their budget, but despite repeated pleas, they just allowed it to be used to kill people. “In the end, there was so little for Facebook to gain from its continued presence in Burma, and the consequences for the Rohingya people could not have been more dire."": https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/06/rohingya-sue-facebook-myanmar-genocide-us-uk-legal-action-social-media-violence

Then he released doctored chat logs that weren't even convincing and showed him to be a credulous, ascientific nut who lacked the capacity or will to do thorough and unbiased investigation.
 
 Edit: and he was suspended by Google because he's obviously a litigation fountain. He immediately played the religion card and then hired a lawyer for the bot.

 It was also against the company's terms of employment, to not discriminate on the basis of gender, which is grounds for termination.

 If you have a controversial opinion, and you air it at work, you're going to have a bad time.
 
 After all of that, we can discuss whether those laws, etc, are worth pushing back on, worth suffering the consequences for. I believe Damore thought it was worth suffering those consequences. My read of him is that he intentionally woke the bear, because he wanted the controversy and attention.

 So many Americans look down their noses at China censoring the Internet and don't realize it's being done at home.

 Let's review the facts:
 - Is the discussion being censored? Yes
 - Does Twitter have the right to do so? Yes
 - Do we know why they've decided to censor the discussion? No
 - Would it be nice to know why? Yes
 - Is this the first time they've censored a hashtag that didn't fit a narrative they're trying to push? No
 
 - Is censorship of a relevant and newsworthy topic that directly and forcefully impacts elections troubling regardless of whether it's a private company? That's your call. But it rubs me the wrong way. And that's why I commented here.

They'll introduce certain things in the feed and see how it influences the positive or negative nature of that persons comments.
 
 So if a marketing company figures out that you see a steak 20 minutes prior to a car ad you are 2% more likely to buy -- you will see a steak in your feed. The data being collected is allowing companies with huge datamining and neural net applications to fine tune the art of manipulation. You might think you are immune. But don't MOST of us waste a lot of time getting upset at something in the news? What long-term effect does that have? How much emotion can we experience before what gets us excited requires more and more outrage?
 
 Are we passive about our world because we know too much about our world? There's a lot of useful information that can be gleaned about REAL human nature; what people do when they think nobody is looking. But all the wrong people are going to use this information for the wrong things. More people will become addicted to more things. More people will tune out. More people will depend on social media while being less social.
