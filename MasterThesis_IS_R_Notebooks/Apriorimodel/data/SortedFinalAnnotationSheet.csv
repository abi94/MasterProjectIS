 Edit: Some things just don't go away, no matter how often they're studied, debated, litigated and tabulated. Take unintended acceleration -- cases in which a car unexpectedly lunges forward. Scientists at institutions up to and including NASA have concluded there's nothing to it but consumers continue to say otherwise. 
 
 ""NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrtion) has not identified any defects with the vehicles that can explain simultaneous failures of the throttle and brake systems,"" said NHTSA's Catherine Howden in a recent press release urging drivers to be sure they weren't accidentally pressing the wrong pedal.
 
 https://www.consumeraffairs.com/amp/news/feds-blame-driver-error-for-16000-annual-unintended-acceleration-cases-060215.html
 
 three possible causes for any incidents:
 
 The vehicle owner mistakenly applied their foot to the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal.
 The vehicle owner has misplaced objects around the pedal area interfering with, and trapping, the accelerator pedal.
 The vehicle owner is confusing their perception of another vehicle operating characteristic that is not actually unintended acceleration, for example, adaptive cruise control resuming the target speed after the vehicle has moved out from behind another vehicle.",-48,"technology","1. article about whistleblower","7. safety","13. only one issue","0. for whistleblowing","2. unrelated to whistleblowing","11. unrelated","11. unrelated","3. unrelated to whistleblowing","",NA

 2. ⁠Facebook's own research showed that a test account with moderate conservative leanings took only 1 day to start getting QAnon content. They nicknamed the test ""Carol's Journey to QAnon"", and despite this, allowed QAnon to remain on the platform for 13 more months. More than a year after the FBI designated them as a domestic terrorist threat: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581
 3. ⁠Their own research showed that suggesting posts to users that their friends have shared radicalized people by giving pschological permission to have extreme views. Basically ""your uncle shared this racist post!"" gives people the greenlight to also share the racist post. Despite this, Zuckerberg himself refused to allow it to be fixed, saying that it would negatively impact growth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak#Promoting_anger-provoking_posts
 4. ⁠Their VP of Global Policy Joel Kaplan is a former Bush advisor and conservative lobbiest. This is important to know for a few of the next points: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kaplan
 5. ⁠Breitbart has repeatedly had enough ""strikes"" to be removed from FB's News tab, but had them waved away personally by Joel Kaplan. The News tab's policies were put into effect to address the concerns around misinformation, saying that FB would remove anyone from the tab that misinformed. Breitbart is still on there today. Facebook endorses the accuracy of Breitbart's reporting by excusing their strikes. https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-files-breitbart-news-tab-employee-objections-2021-10
 6. ⁠When FB employees noticed that the Groups feature was creating new extremist and Neo Nazi groups, they made fixes to tamp down on the hate. Joel Kaplan personally ensured that the fixes were reversed, and again said that doing this would disproportionately affect conservatives: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/28/facebook-zuckerberg-trump-hate/
 7. ⁠Joel Kaplan prevented Facebook from disclosing the effect that Russian disinformation agents had on the platform, again saying this would disproportionately affect conservatives: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-joel-kaplan-facebook-alex-jones
 8. ⁠Research has been published showing that 13% of suicidal teen girls in the UK trace their first suicidal thought to Instagram. Since learning this, Meta has chosen to make Instagram Kids, an Instagram for children: https://gizmodo.com/lawmakers-ask-zuckerberg-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-aft-1847683217
 9. ⁠In order to discredit the Whistleblower, Frances Haugen, Facebook intentionally deepened political divides as a strategy. They went to the GOP and warned them that she was a leftist political activist trying to take away conservative voices; and then went to Dem lawmakers and claimed she is a GOP political operative trying to punish Facebook for banning Trump. FB cynically tried to deepen the cracks in our damaged system just to stick it to the whistlerblower: https://nypost.com/2021/12/29/facebook-tried-to-divide-dems-gop-over-whistleblower-report/
 10. ⁠Facebook sat back and watched as its platform was used to organize a genocide. All they had to do was put the brakes on FB in one small East-Asian country, which wouldn't have even affected their budget, but despite repeated pleas, they just allowed it to be used to kill people. “In the end, there was so little for Facebook to gain from its continued presence in Burma, and the consequences for the Rohingya people could not have been more dire."": https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/06/rohingya-sue-facebook-myanmar-genocide-us-uk-legal-action-social-media-violence

Either that or Indian work visa holders. Some of these people come from areas where there is no formal academic certification or where engineering programs are rote memorization and not actual inspired, critical thinking using math. As a result, production quality suffers. Doesn't help that any part that can be made outside the US, is, so Boeing has to deal with bins full of parts that use different QA rules. Airbus manages this problem much better as this was historically why European industries lagged behind the US's.
 
 Less to do with ""diversity"" (whatever that is really supposed to mean) and more with unrestricted global trade. Boeing is the face of globalization, having enabled so much of it and benefiting from most of it, so this failure is a significant mark against global capitalism's ability to provide high-quality products their former selves (plural because modern Boeing is like four companies merged into a single monopoly) could. This isn't the end of globalism but we've passed it's crest.

His job was mostly done on a computer, like auditing or something, but he described some of the harassment he faced. For example, his open floor-plan office was located in a building with a wraparound hallway and the bathrooms located on the other side of the building. People would take the long way around the building to walk through his workspace and ""accidentally"" knock his laptop to the floor. I've been thinking about that a lot since this Boeing fiasco began.

 He has consistently raised concerns that the narrowbody jet is unsafe and says he once got off a 737 Max before it took off when he realized which plane model he had boarded.
 
 After a 737 Max 9 lost its door plug in midair — leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage , the NTSB said the door plug had been removed in Boeing's factory to fix some broken rivets, but Boeing told investigators it didn't have documentation of this work.
 
 ""With respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share,"" Boeing said in a statement last month.
 
 But Pierson said: ""Records do in fact exist. I know this because I personally passed them to the FBI.
 It has been available for months.""
 
 The FBI is looking into whether criminal charges should be brought against Boeing as a result of the blowout.

 Read the original story from The Intercept.
 
 >Of the 680,000 people caught up in the government’s Terrorist Screening Database—a watchlist of “known or suspected terrorists” that is shared with local law enforcement agencies, private contractors, and foreign governments—more than 40 percent are described by the government as having “no recognized terrorist group affiliation.” That category—280,000 people—dwarfs the number of watchlisted people suspected of ties to al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah combined.
 
 That's still not this bad. [THIS IS BAD, BLACKLISTED](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/23/blacklisted/)
 RIGHT FROM THE HAND BOOK [The Watchlist Guidance](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/07/23/march-2013-watchlisting-guidance/):
 
 >“To meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard, the NOMINATOR, based on the totality of the circumstances, must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrants a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.”
 
 Then goes on to say
 
 >“In determining whether a REASONABLE SUSPICION exists, due weight should be given to the specific reasonable inferences that a NOMINATOR is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his/her experience and not on unfounded suspicions or hunches. **Although irrefutable evidence or concrete facts are not necessary**, to be reasonable, suspicion should be as clear and as fully developed as circumstances permit.”
 
 No facts needed, 280,000 *known* subjects have NO ties to terrorists and are still being watched.

And Vint Cerf.
 
 Then the article says ""There's no firm indication of the meeting's subject matter, but given the long and often tense relationship between Google and the content industry, it seems likely that piracy issues would quickly find their way to the top of the agenda."" So the writer just sort of speculates on this, but states it as fact in the headline.
 
 It seems more like a more all-purpose meeting where Google addresses pernicious problems in search results and indexing: counterfeit goods, piracy, child porn, etc. It just doesn't strike me as some gathering of illuminati to crush piracy specifically. Also, by this standard, any internal meeting in any company could be considered ""secret."" You might have had a ""secret"" meeting today.

 So many Americans look down their noses at China censoring the Internet and don't realize it's being done at home.

 Let's review the facts:
 - Is the discussion being censored? Yes
 - Does Twitter have the right to do so? Yes
 - Do we know why they've decided to censor the discussion? No
 - Would it be nice to know why? Yes
 - Is this the first time they've censored a hashtag that didn't fit a narrative they're trying to push? No
 
 - Is censorship of a relevant and newsworthy topic that directly and forcefully impacts elections troubling regardless of whether it's a private company? That's your call. But it rubs me the wrong way. And that's why I commented here.

 Snowden accidentally released information that pertained to NSA wiretapping in a much larger data release that he was using to cause damage because he was a narcissist that believed he should have had more importance with the government. That's it, just a mentally disturbed guy that bumblefucked his way into being the posterchild for the anti-domestic-espionage (who are great people, mostly, serving an ultimately wonderful purpose) movement.

 Secondly, yes, Greenwald was the hero in this situation, as was the Guardian, for returning all of the data that had nothing to do with the wiretapping program. Snowden released all sorts of stuff, and those guys saved it from getting public.
 
 Thirdly, it makes plenty of sense, as in, he didn't even know it was in his data dump. He grabbed as much as he could, and then he released it and fled. Once he was made aware that it contained the wiretapping information, he began to act like that was his purpose. But that is easily debunked by noting that he released much more than that, but Greenwald and the Guardian refused to publish any of it.

"53h3hz","Don’t just pardon Edward Snowden; give the man a medal","https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/18/dont-just-pardon-edward-snowden-give-the-man-a-medal/","d7t6z3a","Exposing a crime is an excellent argument for a pardon. Snowden's initial leak showed that the US was intercepting and collecting metadata on virtually every domestic phone call. Courts have struck that down as illegal, and Congress voted to change the law once it came to light. This is whistleblowing at its finest.
 
 But Snowden didn't just leak information about illegal or unpopular domestic spying programs. The vast majority of his (published) leaks were about legal, popular foreign spying operations. 
 
 This includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between. It also includes US intelligence about foreign countries spying on each other. Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance. And there's nothing illegal--much less unconstitutional, about foreign surveillance. Leaking classified information just because you personally disagree with a program is not whistleblowing, and the government cannot function if it allows its employees to sabotage any program they dislike. 
 
 Snowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), not for treason, which applies to:
 
 >**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or ***information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates***, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted ***the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;
 
 Now why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US? Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.
 
 [Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): 
 
 >“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.”
 
 [What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):
 
 >Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....
 >
 >...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.
 >
 >They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.
 
 [Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):
 
 >Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. “Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,” Greenwald said. “***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***”
 
 [Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):
 
 >I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he's leaked out of self-preservation
 
 So even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing. Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to ""ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China"" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.
 
 Here's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:
 
 > Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.
 > 
 > Binney: Certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing. At least now they are going to have some kind of open discussion like that.
 > 
 > **But now he is starting to talk about things like the government hacking into China and all this kind of thing. He is going a little bit too far. I don't think he had access to that program. But somebody talked to him about it, and so he said, from what I have read, anyway, he said that somebody, a reliable source, told him that the U.S. government is hacking into all these countries. But that's not a public service, and now he is going a little beyond public service.**

Even if that’s somehow the case, it would be on a much, much smaller scale than minorities face.
 
 The fact that people are making such a big stink about white men being discriminated against in hiring at ONE company is showing exactly why affirmative action should exist.
 
 This happens all the damn time to minorities. It just takes it happening to white people for people to actually get mad.
 
 Edit: looks like the downvoting, oppressed white teenagers are out in full force here. As someone who is a white software engineer, I can tell you right now that it is very easy for someone like me to get a job and I know it’s a lot tougher for someone who’s a different race or gender. The lack of diversity in the field is brutal and the subconscious racism/sexism in hiring is a real thing. As far as I’m concerned, affirmative action all in all just levels the playing field a bit.

I'm black. I'm a senior software engineer, own a home in Silicon Valley, and have a master's degree in Computer science in addition to two undergraduate degrees in engineering. So I know a lot about success. I'll answer your question fully. I'll start now but I need to ask specifically what your heritage is? It matters because different Asian country groups have different institutional acceptance here (Filipinos vs. Japanese for example). My heritage is ""Black"", you'll notice that's not a country. My father was born in 1949. Martin Luther King was shot in 1968. That's a single generation so not distant history.
 
 More on that. Linden Baines Johnson outlawed racial workplace discrimination in 1965. He was made president because of the assassination of JFK. 
 He signed it into law because of rioting caused by the subsequent assassination of MLK and the efforts of other Civil Rights activists who indisputably were black. This paved the way for asians like yourself, but because it was a black resistance movement, we were selected against in order to divide asians and blacks. This unfolded in the same way that Irish were selected against Blacks when blacks were first freed by Lincoln in the 1860s after slavery was abolished. 
 
 You'll notice there are no ""Africa Town"" economic centers in the United States. There are only ""Black neighborhoods"". There is a reason for that. But it is important to note that Black institutions are targeted to stochastically prevent black success stories like me because it is difficult due to the presence of liberal politicians to explicitly target black individuals. Black owned banks are denied bailouts, while white-owned banks are bailed out. Blacks are charged higher interest on loans irrespective of credit scoring or income. Blacks are looked over for promotions despite similar skill sets. Also ""Legacy"" programs were installed at universities and in labor unions which also exclude blacks since their parents were denied entry.",-39,"technology","1. article about whistleblower","3. discrimination","13. only one issue","0. for whistleblowing","2. unrelated to whistleblowing","11. unrelated","11. unrelated","3. unrelated to whistleblowing","",NA

 I just want to point out that according to that screenshot, Google hired 74 people ~~that week towards the end of March~~ year, while it had hired 20 people from its ""diverse"" categories, including women who definitely make up a higher proportion of the population than that. Since recruiters have limited time to pursue applicants, asking them to get in touch specifically with under-represented demographics doesn't sound unreasonable to me.
 
 Also, near as I can tell, this applies to recruiter first contacts, not the interview/hiring process. I worked there as an engineer for two years and the hiring system is set up very specifically to be as ""scientific"" and un-prejudicial as possible. 
 
 Long story short, this sounds like a white guy upset that white (and Asian, yes) guys aren't getting all the attention anymore.
 
 **Edit:** arrey is right that I misread and missed the EOQ label in the hires column. I stand by my fundamental point that targeting under-represented groups is not the same as hiring discrimination.

Yeah, well, that's most of the country, and these people vote. Facebook and their ""subsidiary"" that *pretends* to do stuff without their knowledge have conducted tests on their users. They'll introduce certain things in the feed and see how it influences the positive or negative nature of that persons comments.
 
 So if a marketing company figures out that you see a steak 20 minutes prior to a car ad you are 2% more likely to buy -- you will see a steak in your feed. The data being collected is allowing companies with huge datamining and neural net applications to fine tune the art of manipulation. You might think you are immune. But don't MOST of us waste a lot of time getting upset at something in the news? What long-term effect does that have? How much emotion can we experience before what gets us excited requires more and more outrage?
 
 Are we passive about our world because we know too much about our world? There's a lot of useful information that can be gleaned about REAL human nature; what people do when they think nobody is looking. But all the wrong people are going to use this information for the wrong things. More people will become addicted to more things. More people will tune out. More people will depend on social media while being less social.

 That is non argument. What if it was about a concentration camp guard or about an employee that is told to steal from a customer? Would you still defend them because ""they've got families to support and bills to pay""?
 
 We absolutely can expect everyone to operate on a basic level of decency and professionalism, and that includes not following orders that will put others in harm's way. 
 
 If someone is an engineer that is responsible for anything that can potentially be dangerous and their employer, against the current best practices, orders them to circumvent something that will potentially put hundreds or thousands of lives at risk, they have the duty to refuse, even if it will cost them their job.

 I've seen this story kicking around for a bit, and feel like it deserves a little more context than it's getting. The first thing to explain is a little provision in [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) for what is known as the [Business Associate](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html) (BA). What is a business associate? Here's a good definition straight from that last link (emphasis mine):
 
 > Business associate functions and activities include: claims processing or administration; **data analysis, processing or administration**; utilization review; quality assurance; billing; benefit management; practice management; and repricing. Business associate services are: legal; actuarial; accounting; consulting; **data aggregation**; management; administrative; accreditation; and financial.
 
 For legal purposes, there are ""covered entities"", which basically equal hospitals, health plans, and healthcare providers (e.g. doctors), and those entities can have BAs. Google is a BA in this case, and so is **every electronic health record (EHR) company on the planet**.
 
 Why emphasize that last bit? Because the EHR vendors are **all** doing the exact same stuff as Google, but most people don't know their names, so they fly under the radar. Allscripts has partnered with Microsoft to host their clients' data in Azure, and Cerner is doing the same with Amazon's AWS, just to pick on two. I guarantee you that Amazon and Microsoft are really, really glad that Google is taking this one on the chin while they fly under the radar, and in all three cases this is perfectly legal, because the covered entities have BA Agreements with them. Those same covered entities also often have contracts with dozens, if not hundreds of other companies (or in the case of Ascension--who I used to work for--more like thousands). So what's my point with all this?
 
 The ship of healthcare privacy sailed years ago, in terms of this kind of data management. What keeps things from spiraling out of control are the massive penalties for accidental disclosure or misuse of data. That genie is not going back in the bottle, and I'm also not sure you (the consumer) will want it to. 
 
 The whole point of getting everyone electronic via the HITECH provisions of the stimulus act was so that this kind of data could be aggregated and shared in exactly the way Ascension is doing it. The goal is to use big data tools like AI/ML to find low-hanging fruit to improve quality and cut costs. I worked on a project to automatically diagnose people with chronic kidney disease **ten years ago**. Now we're talking about systems that can predict when you're going to have an asthma attack, and push an alert to your phone to remind you to take your rescue inhaler. That's real--Amazon literally had a presentation on it yesterday.
 
 ""But Ben, why can't they do all that with anonymized data?"" [Well, it's really, really hard to effectively anonymize data](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/health/data-privacy-protection.html), and even if you can, it makes it a lot less useful. Sure, I can strip out your name, SSN, address, etc., but what about your gender, race, marital status, age, and zip code? And what if you want to validate that the inputs are correct, and that you're actually transforming all this as expected? You need the keys to the kingdom. It's contracts and the fear of repercussions from a breach that are keeping everything in line.
 
 If it really bothers you that Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have your health data, your only protection (right now) is to stop going to your health care provider. My guess is that (like with PRISM and Equifax), most people will experience a few minutes of outrage, and then go about their business as usual.

 Now look at the rates of cardio vascular deaths. They've plummeted.
 
 I'll tell you what's going on: the Corona virus IS highly contagious. It sucks if you're in the <10% who show symptoms but not necessarily deadly unless you already had shit that was going to kill you anyway. It weakens you and those other underlying issues takes you out.
 
 Combine that with the feds paying hospitals tens of thousands for corona deaths and now you have a shitload of deaths that would have been reported as cardiovascular or age or whatever being blamed on Corona.

 - at the same time, *there's a massive flu epidemic in the same province according to leaked documents published by CNN* so doctors just think it's the flu
 
 - pattern gradually emerges, and by late December, doctors in Wuhan were puzzled by many pneumonia cases that test negative for the flu
 
 - 30 December 2019, the **Wuhan CDC sent out an internal memo to all Wuhan hospitals** to be alerted and started an investigation into the exact cause of the pneumonia.
 
 - The alert and subsequent news reports were immediately published on ProMED (a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases).
 
 - Same day, Ai Fen, director of the emergency department at Wuhan Central hospital, becomes alarmed after receiving laboratory results of a patient. The report contained the phrase ""SARS coronavirus"". Ai had circled the word ""SARS"", and sent it to a doctor at another hospital in Wuhan.
 
 - From there it spread throughout medical circles in the city, where it reached Li. - **Our whistleblower appears here**
 
 - At 17:43, he wrote in a private WeChat group of his medical school classmates: ""**7 confirmed cases** of SARS were reported [to hospital] from Huanan Seafood Market."" He also posted the patient's examination report and CT scan image. At 18:42, he added ""the latest news is, it has been confirmed that they are coronavirus infections, but the exact virus strain is being subtyped"".
 
 - Li asked the WeChat group members to inform their families and friends to take protective measures whilst requesting discretion from those he shared the information with; he was reportedly upset when the discussion gained a wider audience than he had hoped.
 
 - screenshots of his WeChat messages were shared on Chinese social media and gained more attention. The supervision department of his hospital summoned him for a talk, blaming him for leaking the information.
 
 - **31 December: The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission releases [a public statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109215413/http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989)** ""on pneumonia of unknown etiology"", which was picked up by news organizations around the world. The World Health Organization office in China picked up the media statement from the website of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on cases of viral pneumonia and then notified the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office about the notice from the Wuhan government.
 
 - **On 3 January 2020, police from the Wuhan Public Security Bureau investigating the case interrogated Li**, issued a formal written warning and censuring him for ""publishing untrue statements about seven confirmed SARS cases at the Huanan Seafood Market"". He was **made to sign a letter of admonition promising not to do it again**. The police warned him that any recalcitrant behavior would result in a prosecution.
 
 - Li returned to work at the hospital and contracted the virus on 8 January. 
 
 - China publishes the viral genetic sequence on January 10th, which allows [Moderna to start designing their vaccine, which is finalized by the 13th.](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19)
 
 - On 12 January 2020, Wenliang started having a fever. 
 
 - January 14th, WHO announces in a press conference that they may have found evidence of limited human to human spread within households, but can not confirm yet that it is spreading more widely. The tweet they put out on this day says ""found no *clear* evidence of human-to-human transmission"". Only **41 cases** in total have been confirmed so far, 2 of which are a married couple.
 
 - Li Wenliang is admitted to the hospital on 14 January 2020, along with his parents who presumably contracted COVID from him. Because of poor test quality at this time, they test negative.
 
 - On 20 January, after two medical staff were infected in Guangdong and confirmed positive, China National Health Commission confirmed that the virus was human-to-human transmissible. **291 cases** have been confirmed.
 
 - 23 January, Wuhan locks down. All public transportation from 10 a.m. is shut down and all outbound trains and flights are halted. Flights that are supposed to stop over in Wuhan are redirected to their destinations.
 
 - 24 January, a report by Chinese doctors and scientists published in The Lancet indicates that people can be symptom-free for several days while the coronavirus is incubating, increasing the risk of contagious infection without forewarning signs. By the end of the day the entire province of Hubei goes under lockdown.
 
 - Li is still hospitalized. He tests negative several times for the coronavirus until finally testing positive on 30 January 2020. 
 
 - 31 January, **he publishes his experience in the police station with the letter of admonition on social media.** People are understandably outraged.
 
 - At this point in time China has managed to confirm **9720 cases**, with 15238 suspected(according to leaked CNN documents test results were taking more than 20 days to result so count these all as positive cases). There are 1527 severe cases and 213 deaths.
 
 - Li eventually dies on February 7th [despite being put on life support](https://www.ft.com/content/25102116-494f-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441) There are a total of **31211 confirmed cases** in China.
 
 - February 14th, China loosens requirement to be categorized as ""confirmed"" because nasal swab testing takes too long to get results. Adding cases that meet the new criteria that were previously in the ""suspected cases"" category to the total tally bumps the newly confirmed case count by 15,152, bringing cases to a total of **59,804 confirmed cases**.
 
 - March 19th. [The police are punished for mishandling things. They publicly apologize and retract the letter.](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005349/wuhan-police-apologize-for-punishing-coronavirus-whistleblower) By this time, China has largely gotten COVID under control, with most of their 58 new cases on this day imported from returning travelers. Total confirmed case count is **81174 cases**.
 
 - [April 2nd. Dr. Li Wenliang gets hailed as a National Martyr, the highest possible civilian honor for the dead in China)](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1184565.shtml) China reports 93 new cases, mostly from travelers. Their total confirmed case count is **82724 cases.** Today is **the day the world has finally hit 1 million cases, with 50,000 confirmed deaths.**
 
 - April 7th. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan finally begins lifting travel restrictions. Restrictions on residential communities remain in place; to leave their compounds, residents need to produce a green QR code and a letter from their employer. Mandatory masking and social distancing is in effect. At this time, asymptomatic carriers have been recognized and China reports asymptomatic carriers as a new category in daily reports. **673 asymptomatic carriers** are under medical observation.",1144,"technology","1. article about whistleblower","9. whistleblower retaliation","13. only one issue","0. for whistleblowing","0. general comment about whistleblower","9. whistleblower retaliation","7. safety","0. for whistleblowing","",NA

 Here's an article that describes the paper that Google asked her to withdraw.
 
 And here is the paper itself: 
 
 http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf
 
 Edit : Summary for those who don't want to click.
 It describes 4 risks
 
 1) Big Language models are very expensive, so they will primarily benefit rich organisations (also, environmental impact) 
 2) AI's are trained on large amount of data, usually gathered from the internet. This means that language models will always reflect the language use of majorities over minorities, and because the data is not sanitized, will pick up on racist, sexist or abusive language. 
 3) Language data models actually don't understand language. So, this an opportunity cost because research could have been focused on other methods for understanding language. 
 4) Language models can be used to fake and mislead, potentially mass producing fake news 
 
 One example of a language model going wrong (not related to this incident) is google's AI from 2017. This AI was supposed to analyze the emotional context of text, so figure out whether a given statement was positive or negative. 
 
 It picked up on a variety of biases in the internet, considering homosexual, jewish, black inherently negative words. ""White power"" meanwhile was neutral. Now imagine that such an AI is used for content moderation.

 fucking regulation and laws are the only thing ever stopping companies from going rampant. voting people who actually want to change this is the one thing everyone can do - if you want to do more try to get other people to vote those people instead of trying to get people to boycott a single company which does absolutely nothing while there are still thousands of bad actors out there. you know what happens when facebook or companies like amazon go down? new companies take their place and do exactly the same shit - and all the smaller companies do exactly the same shit anyway. the problem isn't facebook or amazon, the problem is missing regulations and enforcement of the regulations.",996,"technology","1. article about whistleblower","5. manipulation","13. only one issue","0. for whistleblowing","0. general comment about whistleblower","5. manipulation","13. only one issue","0. for whistleblowing","",NA

 The company told staff it would restrict access to some employee message boards that relate to platform safety and protecting elections, both of which come under the umbrella of ""Integrity,"" per The Times.
 
 Some groups would be made private instead of public in the coming months, Facebook said, according to the report. Facebook also said it would go through some Integrity-related discussion groups and start removing people that don't work directly on safety and security, The Times reported.
 
 The move comes a week after former Facebook employee Frances Haugen testified before Congress. Haugen left the company in May 2021, and later leaked internal documents to The Wall Street Journal.

 Edit: 
 Here is the big difference people miss, your union is like a lawyer you can call down at any time to take care of problems with management. You have a contract, you are not an at-will employee.

 Reasonable just means sensible. And it is sensible for a negotiation to start with both parties on either side. It would make no sense for the party to start negotiations already giving up something more than they are legally allowed to. 
 
 BTW, sometimes unions are good for companies too. My company was able to get the union to agree to productivity requirements. Which meant the company had a much stronger case when some workers underperformed.

 But especially for things like retail, there has never (that I know of) really been a union for that in the US, so they are starting from a much smaller place.

"v4gxdm","Leaked Google audio shows employees grilling execs after the company canceled a talk about caste bias","https://archive.ph/htajE","ib5mkqj","Googlers like Tanuja are the one playing woke politics while enjoying the perks of being the Top 1% “economic upper class”. 
 
 You calling yourself a “high caste” demonstrates this is a human folly at your individual level. Shame on you for self labeling that way. While claiming to disavow this. Ironic isn’t it? That’s, if you even understand how irony works. SMH…
 
 Ok let’s get this straight folks. The US had a race discrimination problem rooted in its history. S Africa had apartheid. 
 
 “Caste” is not a similar issue. The Sanskrit word is “jaathi” which is the closest approximation to “profession”. 
 
 India had a system for division of economic labor centuries before the West. You had 4 major professions: educators, warriors, traders and social/public service. There was also a tradition of lineage molded on the apprentice model in that children inherited what their parents did. Plain and simple. 
 
 People could and would move across professions. For instance there are so many temple priests who are not Brahmins. There are so many traders who are Brahmins. 
 
 The British used “caste” as a way to divide and conquer the people. 
 
 People like Tanuja and Themmozhi better focus their energy on understanding history and making a positive difference to todays issues than borrow the burden of a corrupted view and play up politics
 
 Tanuja seems like a spoilt Google brat. Free food, fun and games, contractors doing real work and using her time for non work related drama. 
 
 Drama queens. That’s what they are. 
 
 Be part of progress folks. 
 
 Now, do people from India argue with each other? Hell yea. A country of 1 ducking Billion people. There’s bound to be differences in views and opinions. That doesn’t mean “all” disagreements you see between Indian origin folks in the US is due to “caste”. 
 
 Jaathi is NOT caste.

 He's a modern-day version of an 1800s spiritualist, cloaking himself in the scientific sounding titles while desperately trying to prove his preconceived beliefs rather than honestly and sincerely seeking the truth.
 
 The truth is that there's not a shred of evidence it's anything but a sophisticated chat model working off of an enormous corpus, and like many before him dating back to the 1980s, he simply got fooled. Then he released doctored chat logs that weren't even convincing and showed him to be a credulous, ascientific nut who lacked the capacity or will to do thorough and unbiased investigation.
 
 Edit: and he was suspended by Google because he's obviously a litigation fountain. He immediately played the religion card and then hired a lawyer for the bot. They didn't suspend him because there was doubt he needed to go, they suspended him to make sure legal was solid on their defense for his inevitable wrongful termination suit.
