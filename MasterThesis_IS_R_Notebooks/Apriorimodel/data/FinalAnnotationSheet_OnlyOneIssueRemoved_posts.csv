 He has consistently raised concerns that the narrowbody jet is unsafe and says he once got off a 737 Max before it took off when he realized which plane model he had boarded.
 
 After a 737 Max 9 lost its door plug in midair — leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage , the NTSB said the door plug had been removed in Boeing's factory to fix some broken rivets, but Boeing told investigators it didn't have documentation of this work.
 
 ""With respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share,"" Boeing said in a statement last month.
 
 But Pierson said: ""Records do in fact exist. I know this because I personally passed them to the FBI.
 It has been available for months.""
 
 The FBI is looking into whether criminal charges should be brought against Boeing as a result of the blowout.

 Edit: and he was suspended by Google because he's obviously a litigation fountain. He immediately played the religion card and then hired a lawyer for the bot.
